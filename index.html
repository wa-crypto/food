      	 Basketball is a very fun sport to play, It requires a lot of practice and skill. 
       The goal of the game is to shoot the ball through the net. There are many ways to score. A layup 
       would be two points, a jump shot would be two points, and a three pointer is three points. There are four quarters and 
       each one is 12 minutes. There are five players on each team and 10 bench players. There is one coach that is there during
       the game. Basketball players are usually very tall. The height of a basketball hoop is 10 feet. Dunking is one of the hardest
       ways to score in a real basketball game. These are all the basics for learning basketball.

	There are many lines on a basketball court that you have to know about. The most important would be the out of bounds line which is 
all around the court. You step out of bounds, it is the other teams ball. There is a free throw line. This is where you go to if you 
get fouled. Then you take two shots there. There is a half court line indicating the seperation of the court. There is also a three
point line. If you shoot behind this and make, you get three points. The base line is the start of one end of the basketball court.
There is a place called the key which is inside the free throw line.

    There are many ways to get better at playing basketball. The first step would be to practicing your dribbling. You can get
  get better at dribbling by doing between the legs and other moves. Once you master this skill, you need to improve your stamina
  and strength. Stamina will improve if you run a lot, and strength will improve if you do things such as push-ups. Getting your 
  shooting to be accurate would be the next step. The only way to practice this is to have a good shooting form and to keep
  shooting everyday. The last thing you need to work on would be defense which is really important in a real game.
